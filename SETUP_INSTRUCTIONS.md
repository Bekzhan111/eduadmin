## 🔧 Required Setup Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

**To get these values:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → API
3. Copy the Project URL and anon/public key
4. Copy the service_role key (keep this secret!)

### 2. Database Setup
Run the migration files in your Supabase SQL editor:

1. Go to your Supabase project → SQL Editor
2. Run the contents of `src/migrations/fix_rls_users_policy_safer.sql`
3. This will set up the users table and Row Level Security policies

### 3. Database Schema
Your database should have these tables:
- `users` - User accounts with roles and school associations
- `schools` - School information
- `registration_keys` - Keys for role-based registration

In your Supabase project:
1. Go to Authentication → Settings
2. Set up your site URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for development)
3. Add redirect URLs for auth callbacks
