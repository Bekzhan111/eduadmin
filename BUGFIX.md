No bugs reported yet.

## Resolved Bugs

### 1. Row Level Security Policies with USING + WITH CHECK
**Issue:** When creating RLS policies for INSERT operations, encountered error that requested WITH CHECK expression instead of USING.

**Fix:** Changed the policy syntax to use WITH CHECK for INSERT operations instead of USING.

```sql
-- Incorrect syntax
create policy "Super admin can insert users"
on public.users for insert
using (exists (...))
with check (true);

-- Correct syntax
create policy "Super admin can insert users"
on public.users for insert
with check (exists (...));
```

### 2. useState vs useEffect Hook
**Issue:** Incorrect usage of useState hook with a callback function and dependency array, which is the pattern for useEffect.

**Fix:** Changed to useEffect hook for handling side effects on component mount.

```jsx
// Incorrect
useState(() => {
  // Side effect code
}, []);

// Correct
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code
}, [dependencies]);
```

### 3. Type Issues with Form Values
**Issue:** Type errors when using string vs number in form values with zod and react-hook-form.

**Fix:** Used z.coerce.number() for number inputs to properly handle type conversion.

```typescript
// Incorrect
z.string().transform(val => parseInt(val, 10)).refine(val => !isNaN(val) && val > 0)

// Correct
z.coerce.number().min(1)
```

### 4. TailwindCSS PostCSS Plugin Configuration
**Issue:** Build error when TailwindCSS wasn't properly configured with the correct PostCSS plugin.

**Fix:** Updated postcss.config.js to use @tailwindcss/postcss instead of tailwindcss directly.

```javascript
// Incorrect
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}

// Correct
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 5. ESLint Errors with Unused Variables
**Issue:** ESLint errors for intentionally unused variables in function parameters.

**Fix:** Updated ESLint configuration to ignore variables starting with underscore.

```javascript
// Add to eslint.config.mjs
{
  rules: {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": ["error", {
      "argsIgnorePattern": "^_",
      "varsIgnorePattern": "^_"
    }]
  }
}
```

### 6. Next.js Cookies API Type Issue
**Issue:** Type error with cookies() function returning a Promise in newer versions of Next.js.

**Fix:** Updated the cookies handling in Supabase server client to use async/await.

```typescript
// Incorrect
const cookieStore = cookies();
return cookieStore.get(name)?.value;

// Correct
async get(name: string) {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  return cookieStore.get(name)?.value;
}
```

### 7. Tailwind CSS v4 Unknown Utility Classes
**Issue:** Build error: "Cannot apply unknown utility class: bg-white" when using Tailwind CSS v4, which is still in early stages.

**Fix:** 
Downgraded from Tailwind CSS v4 to v3.4.1 which has better compatibility with Next.js:

```bash
# Remove Tailwind CSS v4
npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss

# Install Tailwind CSS v3 with compatible dependency versions
npm install tailwindcss@3.4.1 postcss@8.4.35 autoprefixer@10.4.17 --save-dev
```

And updated configuration files:

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}

// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // Standard Tailwind CSS v3 configuration
  // No need for explicit color definitions
}
```

### 8. Turbopack Compatibility with Tailwind CSS
**Issue:** After configuring Tailwind CSS, encountered Turbopack errors during development.

**Fix:** Removed the `--turbopack` flag from the development script in package.json to use the standard Next.js development server which has better compatibility with Tailwind CSS.

```json
// Before
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
  // other scripts
}

// After
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  // other scripts
}
```

### 9. Error Handling in User Data Fetching
**Issue:** Error in KeyManagement component when fetching user data: `Error fetching user info: {}` with no useful error details.

**Fix:** Improved error handling in the KeyManagement component:
1. Added proper session error handling
2. Added checks for userData existence
3. Added appropriate error messages for different failure scenarios
4. Set loading state properly on error conditions
5. Made async functions properly awaited
6. Added nested try/catch blocks to better isolate and report database errors

4. **Login Flow:** Added session validation before redirect to ensure auth state is properly established

**Files Changed:**
- .env.local (created from .env)

- Created school_books association table for library management
- Added proper Row Level Security policies for all new tables
- Fixed all column references to match database schema

**Database Changes Applied:**
```sql
-- Added missing columns to schools table
ALTER TABLE schools 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS address TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS city TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS bin TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS registration_key TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);

-- Created books and school_books tables with proper RLS policies
```

**Files Changed:**
- Database schema via Supabase migrations
- No code changes required as columns were already referenced correctly

## Notes
- All fixes include proper error handling and user feedback
- TypeScript strict mode compliance maintained
- Dark mode compatibility ensured for all UI changes
- Safe clipboard operations implemented with fallback mechanisms
- School selection validation ensures proper key generation hierarchy
- Key visibility sections follow consistent design patterns across all management pages
