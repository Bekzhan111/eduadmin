## üîß Technical Implementation

### Media Upload Utility (`src/utils/mediaUpload.ts`)
```typescript
export const uploadMedia = async (file: File, type: MediaType): Promise<UploadResult>
export const uploadMediaFromUrl = async (url: string, type: MediaType): Promise<UploadResult>
export const validateFile = (file: File, type: MediaType): { valid: boolean; error?: string }
export const deleteMedia = async (url: string): Promise<boolean>
```

### Enhanced Element Types
```typescript
type CanvasElement = {
  type: 'text' | 'shape' | 'image' | 'line' | 'paragraph' | 'arrow' | 'icon' | 'video';
  properties: {
    imageUrl?: string;
    videoUrl?: string;
    autoplay?: boolean;
    muted?: boolean;
    controls?: boolean;
    loop?: boolean;
    // ... other properties
  };
};
```

### Tools Enhancement
- Added video upload tool
- Added video-by-URL tool
- Enhanced image upload tool
- Integrated with drag-and-drop system

## üöÄ Build Status

### Clean Build Results
```bash
‚úì Compiled successfully in 4.0s
‚úì Linting and checking validity of types  
‚úì No ESLint warnings or errors
‚úì Collecting page data
‚úì Generating static pages (22/22)
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Editor Page Size**: 31.3 kB (optimized for media-rich editor)
- **First Load**: 184 kB (excellent for feature-rich media editor)
- **Build Time**: 4.0s (fast compilation with media support)

## üìã Setup Requirements

### Supabase Storage Configuration
To enable media upload functionality, execute this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create media storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) VALUES ('media', 'media', true);

-- Set up RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Public can view media" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'media');
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload media" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'media' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Configure file types and size limits
UPDATE storage.buckets SET 
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp', 'video/mp4', 'video/webm', 'video/ogg', 'video/mov', 'video/avi'],
  file_size_limit = 104857600 
WHERE id = 'media';
```

## üé® User Experience

### Media Tools Panel
- **Upload Tool**: Direct file upload with progress indication
- **Video Tool**: Video file upload with format validation
- **Video URL Tool**: Embed videos from external URLs
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for upload failures

### Enhanced Properties Panel
- **Image Properties**: URL input and upload button
- **Video Properties**: URL input, upload button, and playback controls
- **Video Controls**: Checkboxes for autoplay, muted, controls, loop
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant property changes

### Drag-and-Drop Integration
