## Current Status: School Registration Key Fix - Completed ✅

### Issue Identified and Fixed 🔧

**Problem:** When users tried to register with a school key, they were being registered as students instead of school administrators, and the system wasn't properly handling school key registration flow.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Role Registration Form was directly calling `register_with_key` without checking key type
2. Login Form registration tab was blocking school keys but pointing to wrong page
3. No dedicated page for school administrator registration with proper school information collection
4. School keys needed special handling to create both user account AND school record

### Solution Implemented ✅

1. **Modified Role Registration Form to Handle School Keys Inline** (`src/components/auth/role-registration-form.tsx`)
   - Added dynamic key type detection with debounced validation
   - Shows school information form section automatically when school key is detected
   - Handles both user account creation and school record creation in single flow
   - Comprehensive validation for school fields (name, city, type, counts required)
   - Links user to school with proper role assignment
   - Updates key usage count correctly
   - Single page experience without redirects

2. **Updated Login Form Registration Tab** (`src/components/auth/login-form.tsx`)
   - Fixed error messages to direct users to role registration page
   - Updated instructions to clarify inline school registration process
   - Removed references to separate school admin registration page

3. **Removed Separate School Admin Registration Page**
   - Deleted `/school-admin-registration` page as no longer needed
   - All registration now handled inline on existing forms

### Technical Implementation ✅

- **Dynamic Form Fields:** School information fields appear automatically when school key detected
- **Real-time Key Validation:** Debounced key checking shows key type immediately
- **Single Flow:** No page redirects or multi-step processes required
- **Comprehensive Validation:** All school fields validated before submission
- **Database Integration:** Creates school record and links user in single transaction
- **Error Handling:** Detailed error messages for all failure scenarios

### Build Status ✅

- ✅ `npm run build` - Zero errors
- ✅ `npm run lint` - Zero warnings
- ✅ All TypeScript types properly defined
- ✅ Removed unused route `/school-admin-registration`

### Testing Required 🧪

1. Test school key registration flow end-to-end
2. Verify school record creation in database
3. Test user-school association
4. Verify key usage tracking
5. Test error scenarios (invalid keys, expired keys, etc.)

**Status: Ready for testing - School registration key issue resolved**

## Current Status: URL Transliteration Implementation - Completed ✅

### Latest Task: Cyrillic to Latin URL Transliteration

#### Task Description
User reported that when writing book names in Russian (Cyrillic), the generated URL was also in Cyrillic. For SEO and URL compatibility, URLs need to be in Latin alphabet only.

#### Implementation Status ✅

1. **Problem Analysis** ✅
   - Book creation page was generating URLs with Cyrillic characters
   - URLs like `математика-5-класс` instead of `matematika-5-klass`
   - Poor SEO and URL compatibility issues

2. **Transliteration Solution** ✅
   - ✅ **Created Comprehensive Transliteration Function**:
     - Complete Cyrillic to Latin character mapping
     - Handles both uppercase and lowercase Russian letters
     - Special character combinations: ж→zh, ч→ch, ш→sh, щ→shch, ю→yu, я→ya
     - Removes soft/hard signs (ъ, ь) as they don't transliterate
   - ✅ **Enhanced URL Generation**:
     - First applies transliteration to convert Cyrillic to Latin
     - Then cleans up to only allow a-z, 0-9, and spaces
     - Converts spaces to hyphens
     - Removes duplicate hyphens
     - Trims leading/trailing hyphens

3. **Examples of Transliteration** ✅
   - "Математика 5 класс" → "matematika-5-klass"
   - "Русский язык" → "russkiy-yazyk"
   - "Физика и химия" → "fizika-i-khimiya"
   - "История Казахстана" → "istoriya-kazakhstana"

4. **Technical Implementation** ✅
   ```typescript
   const transliterateCyrillic = (text: string): string => {
     const cyrillicToLatin: { [key: string]: string } = {
       'а': 'a', 'б': 'b', 'в': 'v', 'г': 'g', 'д': 'd', 'е': 'e', 'ё': 'yo',
       'ж': 'zh', 'з': 'z', 'и': 'i', 'й': 'y', 'к': 'k', 'л': 'l', 'м': 'm',
       'н': 'n', 'о': 'o', 'п': 'p', 'р': 'r', 'с': 's', 'т': 't', 'у': 'u',
       'ф': 'f', 'х': 'kh', 'ц': 'ts', 'ч': 'ch', 'ш': 'sh', 'щ': 'shch',
       'ъ': '', 'ы': 'y', 'ь': '', 'э': 'e', 'ю': 'yu', 'я': 'ya',
       // + uppercase versions
     };
     return text.split('').map(char => cyrillicToLatin[char] || char).join('');
   };
   ```

### Technical Implementation ✅

#### Sidebar Control System
```typescript
// Main navigation sidebar toggle
const toggleMainSidebar = () => {
  const newHiddenState = !mainSidebarHidden;
  setMainSidebarHidden(newHiddenState);
  
  const newSearchParams = new URLSearchParams(searchParams?.toString());
  if (newHiddenState) {
    newSearchParams.set('hideSidebar', 'true');
  } else {
    newSearchParams.delete('hideSidebar');
  }
  
  const newUrl = `${window.location.pathname}?${newSearchParams.toString()}`;
  window.history.replaceState({}, '', newUrl);
  window.location.reload();
};
```

#### Dashboard Layout Integration
```typescript
// Auto-hide sidebar in book editor if requested
useEffect(() => {
  if (isBookEditorPage && shouldHideSidebar) {
    setSidebarOpen(false);
  }
}, [isBookEditorPage, shouldHideSidebar]);
```

#### Canvas Drop Zone
```typescript
function DroppableCanvas({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { setNodeRef, isOver } = useDroppable({
    id: 'canvas-drop-zone',
  });

  return (
    <div
      ref={setNodeRef}
      className={`relative bg-white border-2 shadow-lg ${
        isOver ? 'border-blue-500 bg-blue-50' : 'border-gray-300'
      } transition-colors`}
      style={{
        width: `${canvasWidth * 3.7795}px`,
        height: `${canvasHeight * 3.7795}px`,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Current Status: Critical Editor Bugs Fixed - Completed ✅

### Latest Task: Fix Three Critical Bugs in Drag-and-Drop Editor

#### Task Description
User reported three critical bugs that were severely impacting the editor's usability:
1. Text styling issues (color, bold, italic, underline not working)
2. Backspace deleting entire elements instead of characters
3. Drag-and-drop animation jumping back to original position

#### Implementation Status ✅

1. **Text Styling Bug Fixes** ✅
   - **Added Missing Properties**: Extended TypeScript interface with `fontStyle` and `textDecoration`
   - **Fixed Bold Button**: Properly uses `fontWeight` property for bold text styling
   - **Fixed Italic Button**: Corrected to use `fontStyle` instead of `fontWeight` for italic text
   - **Implemented Underline**: Added full functionality for underline toggle with `textDecoration`
   - **Color Application**: Fixed color changes to apply in both display and editing modes
   - **Real-time Updates**: All styling changes now reflect immediately in canvas

2. **Backspace Text Editing Fix** ✅
   - **Editing Mode Detection**: Added `editingText` state tracking to keyboard handler
   - **Event Scope Control**: Global keyboard handler now exits early when in editing mode
   - **Text Input Protection**: Added `stopPropagation()` to text input events
   - **Proper Backspace Behavior**: Backspace now works normally in text fields
   - **Element Deletion Control**: Element deletion only occurs when not editing text
   - **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter saves, Escape cancels editing

3. **Drag Animation Bug Fix** ✅
   - **Coordinate System Fix**: Changed from delta-based to absolute coordinate positioning
   - **Pointer Event Usage**: Properly cast `activatorEvent` as `PointerEvent` for coordinate access
   - **Immediate Positioning**: Elements now drop exactly where user releases them
   - **Smooth Animation**: Eliminated jarring jump-back behavior
   - **Professional UX**: Drag and drop now matches Canva/Figma standards

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Text Styling Architecture:**
```typescript
// Enhanced TypeScript interface
type CanvasElement = {
  properties: {
    fontWeight?: string;     // 'normal' | 'bold'
    fontStyle?: string;      // 'normal' | 'italic'  
    textDecoration?: string; // 'none' | 'underline'
    color?: string;          // Hex color values
  };
};

// Fixed property button implementations
const toggleBold = () => updateElementProperties(id, { 
  fontWeight: fontWeight === 'bold' ? 'normal' : 'bold'
});
const toggleItalic = () => updateElementProperties(id, { 
  fontStyle: fontStyle === 'italic' ? 'normal' : 'italic'
});
const toggleUnderline = () => updateElementProperties(id, { 
  textDecoration: textDecoration === 'underline' ? 'none' : 'underline'
});
```

**Keyboard Event Management:**
```typescript
// Smart keyboard handler with editing mode awareness
const handleKeyDown = useCallback((e: KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (editingText) return; // Don't interfere with text editing
  
  if (e.key === 'Backspace' && selectedElements.length > 0) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Only delete elements when not editing text
    updateCanvasElements(prev => prev.filter(el => !selectedElements.includes(el.id)));
  }
}, [editingText, selectedElements]);

// Text input event isolation
const handleEditingKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => {
  e.stopPropagation(); // Prevent global handlers
  if (e.key === 'Enter') saveContent();
  if (e.key === 'Escape') cancelEditing();
};
```

**Drag Animation System:**
```typescript
// Absolute coordinate positioning system
const handleDragEnd = (event: DragEndEvent) => {
  const pointerEvent = event.activatorEvent as PointerEvent;
  const rect = canvasRef.current?.getBoundingClientRect();
  
  const newX = pointerEvent.clientX - rect.left - element.width / 2;
  const newY = pointerEvent.clientY - rect.top - element.height / 2;
  
  // Immediate positioning without delta calculations
  updateElement({ x: newX, y: newY });
};
```
